run function repeatString
repeatString takes 2 arguments
function repeatString(string, num)
function repeatString('Hi', 2)
It will return, "Hi""Hi"

What do I need?
create function repeatString(string, num) {
    this body will do what?
        take the string and repeat it based on the num
        how will I determine how many times it repeats?
            num = times it is repeated
            let i = 0 (starts), i++ (infinitely repeats until we tell function to stop)
            condition is num
            for (i = 0, i < num, i++)
        ok. now what?
        I have what repeating? i.
        i is what?     
}
